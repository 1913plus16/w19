  <b> Yossi Hertzberg (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Joseph, but everyone has always called me by my nickname, Yossi. I am a third year CS major and I am very excited to be one of your tutors for CS16. I worked as a tutor in high school as well, and I loved finding ways to make some of the same topics that I struggled with in a class less confusing for the next generation. I took CS16 during my freshman year here, so I hope to be able to help in this same way. I actually started at UCSB as a Mechanical Engineering major but found (eventually) that CS was much better for me, so I can help with many questions regarding major switching, especially into the CS department. Also, I love helping people see how to approach problems algorithmically in a way that a computer can understand, as this knowledge will help in all CS classes, and in any programming language. Outside of school, I love surfing, mountain biking, and playing with my two dogs. 
Please do not hesitate to reach out to me with any questions on Piazza.
