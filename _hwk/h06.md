Read Chapter 5.1 thru 5.4. Read the lecture slides for topics on binary arithmetic.  You don't need to turn this homework in. Please turn in the physical copy of your homework in person. Write in PEN or DARK PENCIL.

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!<br/>
FOR BEST RESULTS, PRINT THIS PAGE AS A PDF, THEN PRINT THE PDF</b>



1.(2 pts) What happens if you forget the return statement in a void-function?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.(4 pts) Can you define a function in the body of another function? And can you call a function in the body of another function?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3.(8 pts) Write a void-function definition for a function called "zero_both" with 2 parameters, both which are variables of type int, and sets the value of both variables to 0. Describe if you picked this function to be a call-by-reference or a call-by-value AND WHY?
<div style="margin-bottom:12em"></div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

4.(10 pts) What is the output of the program below (write it in the space to the right)?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void phooey(int &z) {
  z = z / 2;
  cout << "z=" << z << endl;
  }

int main() {
  int b = 3;
  phooey(b);
  cout << "b=" << b << endl;
  return 0;
  }
```
</div>

5.(2 pts) What is the meaning of the ampersand character (&) in the code above?
<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>


6.(8 pts) What is the output of the following code? If there's an error that will not allow an output, point it out.

<div markdown="1">

```cpp

void foo(int* a, int* b, int& c, int d) {
  *a = *a + 2;
  b = b + 2;
  c = c + 2;
  d = d + 2;
}

int main() {
  int x = 10, y = 15, z = 20, s = 30;
  foo(&x, &y, z, s);
  cout << x << ", " << y << ", " << z << ", " << s <<endl;
  return 0;
}
```

7.(16 pts) Write the output for each segment of code below. Assume p is always created at the location 0x8000 and x is always created at the location 0x9000. If the code prints a junk value, show that value using the symbol ?. Identify undefined behaviour or compile-time/run time errors. 

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int main(){
      int x; 
      int* p = &x;
      cout << p << *p << &x<< endl; 
      return 0;
}
``` 

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int main(){
      int* p = 0;
      cout << p << *p <<endl; 
      return 0;
}     
``` 

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int main(){
      int* p;
      cout << p << &p <<endl; 
       return 0;
}
``` 

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int main(){
      int* p = new int; //Assume the int is created at location 0x9000
      cout << p << *p << &p << endl; 
             return 0;
}
```
