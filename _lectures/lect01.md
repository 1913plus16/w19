# Info for Crashers

We are overenrolling the course beyond the lab capacity; 
the highest positions on the waitlist are being offered add codes today.  If you don't get an
add code today, you won't get an add code for this section.

An additional lecture section of CS16 has been added with lectures in NH 1105, TR 2-3:15, and discussion
sections at 5pm and 6pm.   Information about the waitlist for that section will be announced
at that lecture.

    * commenting your code
    * standard input, standard output and standard error with `cin`, `cout`, `cerr`
* The three stages of writing and executing C++ code: editing, compiling, (linking and) executing
* Compiling code with `g++`
* Finding your way around with basic unix commands - `mkdir`, `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm` (use with caution because it deletes files irrecoverably)
* Choosing an editor (vim or emacs)- may the best editor win!
* Remote login with ssh
