# Topics
## File I/O basics
* Intro to lab03
* Examining text files using 1) an editor 2) cat command
* Opening a file: open()
* Reading a line from a file: getline()
* Reading until the end of file is reached
* Detecting failures
* Printing error messages to standard error with cerr
* When do we use exit() and why?

# Data representation

* How is data (numbers for now) represented in memory?
* Positional encoding (Decimal, Binary, Hex,...any base)
* Number conversions 
* Big idea: 
	* Bits can represent anything!
	* Data is stored in memory using finite number of bits (use this to determine range of values that can be stored in any type)
