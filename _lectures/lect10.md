# Topics

## Code from lecture


## Pointers and structs
* Declaring structs
* Different ways of accessing member variables of a structs
* Pointers to structs, why and when to use them?
* Passing structs to functions by value, by reference and by address
* Pointer pitfalls


## C++ References
* Creating aliases with references
* Differences between references and pointers
* Constant pointers and references, when and why to use them


## Mechanics of function calls with specific attention to call by reference
* Program layout: text, data, bss, stack and heap
* References as function formal arguments
* More on the run-time stack

## C++ Memory model
* Barebones model of memory: value vs address
* Scope: local vs. global
* Layout of compiled C++ program in memory: text, global data , heap and stack

## Intro to lab05
