## Code from lecture
[https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-f18-mirza/cs16-s18-lectures/tree/master/lec-14](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-f18-mirza/cs16-s18-lectures/tree/master/lec-14)

## Topics
* Thinking recursively about problems on sequences
* Recursion vs. iteration via examples: printing elements of an array in order and in reverse order, printing elements of a linked-list in order and in reverse order
* How do we know our recursive solution is correct? Proof by induction
* Is recursive better than iterative?
* Problems that have a naturally recursive solution
* Under the hood of recursive functions (how recursive functions use the stack)
* Helper functions
* Recursion on strings
